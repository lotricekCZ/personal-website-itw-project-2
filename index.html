					I am a student of Faculty of information technology on BUT, who
					was involved in computer science in junior high school, where
					I participated in in projects beyond the curriculum. Beyond
					the curriculum, I got excited about technology in general.
					I am sometimes seen by people around me as a very calm person
					who has no problem helping out when the going gets tough.

							As far as I can tell this is very renomed, yet somehow mistified university. 
							It gives you a very thorough view to each IT field you can imagine even in their basic lectures

							lecture in programmes that demand it.

						<p class="time period">May 19th 2024 - Present</p>
						<p class="project verbose"> This minimalistic project is a django application that uses my knowledge acquired in ITW to test knowledge of material engineering students at the FME BUT. The questions were scraped out of a pdf file I was provided and with a little knowledge of regex I managed to get them in a viable format to process them later on. This was a request from my close family member and I decided to make that happen. I fullfilled request of my father who works as a webmaster to get it working in a docker container.</p>

							<h3>Robot simulator</h3>
							<h4>ICP project @ FIT BUT</h4>
						</div>
						<p class="time period">February 7th - May 29th 2024</p>
						<p class="project verbose"> Project that proofs both my skills in C++ and work under pressure with determining what is justifiable and what is not so crucial. Goal of this subject was to create a simulation with simplified physics, robots that have very primitive state machine that guides them and user controlled robots (I chose WASD to do have this behaviour) with QT GUI, loading and saving simulations and more.
							I chose OpenGL as a viewport renderer to spice things up a bit.
							This project was intended to be for a group of 2, unfortunately my colleage didn't make it on a weekend before deadline he had a breakdown due to all the other subjects and responsibilities he had to fullfill and stepped out without writing a single line, thus I had to do very minimalistic GUI in a very brief timeframe and matching only a bare minimum of what it could've possibly be. That's also when I felt challenged and opted for OpenGL as mentioned above.</p>

						<p class="time period">Today, April 26th 2024</p>
						<p class="project verbose"> This website is, in fact, a result of me studying on FIT BUT too and I had to craft it within very short period of time thanks to all the previous projects I had to fullfill for results but also for my own pleasure of finishing them without having to worry about my study result. As of now, it's still a static webpage with very minimalistic approach, which you may inspect in your browser right now by pressing F12.</p>

The main objective is to terminate all of them by taking them to the top of the hill with a skibus and thus making them finish their duty.</p>

However it was not accepted due to my belief that it should use CMake as a build system in order to simplify the unnecessarily difficult compilation, which, unfortunately, was not present on the testing environment, which was nowhere stated.

							This was one of my long lasting projects for an international robotics competition. It showcases my skills in electronic and 3D design, because I never settled for using building kits and prepared modules, but it also shows my learning curve in C++ development. Even though proportions of the competition clearly state that it is intended for a groups of 4, this is what I developed as a single being at very young age.</p>
